~~~~~~~  Set up Heroku ~~~~~ Install the heroku CLI

$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: {your heroku email}
Password (typing will be hidden):
Authentication successful.
Preparing The Application
When your project is ready for deployment here are the key steps you have to take.

Add a Procfile
Update requirements.txt
Install Gunicorn and Heroku DJango
Add a runtime.txt to specify the correct Python version in project root
Configure whitenoise to serve static files
The Procfile
Create a file named Procfile (without a file extension) in the root of your project directory.

1. touch Procfile

2. web: gunicorn catcollector_project.wsgi

The runtime.txt
In terminal run..

python3 -V
this will give you your python version you are using for your project.

Create a file called runtime.txt.

touch runtime.txt
In the root project directory with the following info about your python project.

python-{your version number}

Supported Python Runtimes

Install Gunicorn and Django-On-Heroku
Now to install a few necessary packages.

In your project folder, with the environment activated, run the following..

pip3 install django-on-heroku
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 install whitenoise

pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

This will install the helper addons for heroku. Now we must add it into our project. Add to your settings.py

# after "from pathlib import Path"
import django_on_heroku

# at the bottom of the file
django_on_heroku.settings(locals())
Now to install Gunicorn and Whitenoise!

Git Add & Commit Changes

Add all Heroku config changes

git add -A
Commit changes

git commit -m "Adds heroku deployment config"

Time to Deploy!
Inside your project folder run..

heroku create quotecollector-dk --buildpack heroku/python

This will take some time as heroku sets up your heroku remote git.

Once that is complete its time to add a Database to our heroku application.

heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
Now you can git add and git commit.

Once that is complete you can now push to Heroku!

git push heroku master
Once that is completed we need to migrate our database just as we would on our own devices.

OPEN THE HEROKU CONSOLE

heroku run bash
INSIDE THE HEROKU CONSOLE RUN

python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
EXIT THE HEROKU CONSOLE

exit
And viola! Your Django application is officially online! You can run the following command to view it.

heroku open
Once you have tested your application and everything is lookging great it's time to turn off debug mode!

in settings.py

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = False # change this line to false
now just add, commit and push up to heroku.
